<p>HOW MUCH WILL I MAKE?</p>
<p>If you gain employment as a nanny you will be paid a competitive rate that will be negotiated before the contract between you and the family is signed.</br>
As a babysitter you will be paid a base rate of $15/hour. Depending on the number of children this rate may increase. You will be paid in cash at the end of your working hours.</p>

<p>WHAT IF I HAVE TO CANCEL ON A FAMILY?</p>
<p>If you have to cancel you must notify Robin & Roo as soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements. We understand that illnesses and emergencies do happen and we also expect the highest level of integrity from our sitters and nannies. If a babysitter repeatedly cancels they will not be considered for future positions.</p>

<p>HOW LONG AFTER I APPLY UNTIL I FIND OUT IF MY APPLICATION HAS BEEN ACCEPTED?</p>

<p>CAN I BE BOTH A FULL OR PART-TIME NANNY AND AN ON-CALL BABYSITTER?</p>
